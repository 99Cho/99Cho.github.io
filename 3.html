    <p> To make the supply of something <strong>last a bit longer, by using it carefully</strong>.</p> It’s what you do when you only have a small quantity of something, and you want it to last as long as possible. 
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        Because of the storm, we had to <strong>eke out</strong> food supplies before we could get to the shops again.<br><br>Our crops have failed this year so we can hardly <strong>eke out</strong> a living.<br><br>I’ve lost my job, so I need to <strong>eke out</strong> what savings I have to survive.
